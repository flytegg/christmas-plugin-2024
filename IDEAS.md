# – Flyte Christmas Event Notebook –

## General:

- Add a sled slide in the lobby + carousel for static entertainment while giveaways/game selection is happening.

- eliminated players get titles/nudges to donate while they wait (clickable links)
    - On-Screen Banner ads using bossbars, resource packs and displays.
- Staff Utils Menu:
    - Teleport all players to a “screenie” location. player’s movement is locked and facing forward to facilitate an easy event screenie. (ik stephen

# PlayTest Notes:

### Bauble Tag Stuff

- stxphen got eliminated twice in bauble tag (double tag, somehow)
- eliminate players bauble tag properly
- being able to tag twice?
- add remaining players in the sidebar for bauble tag.
- Shrinking border for Bauble Tag possibly. (probably not if using new/better map)

Extra considerations:

- fix bossbar colours
- also rework avalanche roof designs/ideas.
- Remove glowstone from forest map.
- work out scoring ratio (games like paint wars cant add 4000+ points)
- fix the END button to be in winner overview as well.
