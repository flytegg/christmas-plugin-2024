# – Flyte Christmas Event Notebook –

## General:

- Add a sled slide in the lobby + carousel for static entertainment while giveaways/game selection is happening.
- eliminated players get titles/nudges to donate while they wait (clickable links)
    - On-Screen Banner ads using bossbars, resource packs and displays.
- Staff Utils Menu:
    - Teleport all players to a “screenie” location. player’s movement is locked and facing forward to facilitate an easy event screenie. (ik stephen
      will love this)

## Game Specific:

### Sled Racing:

- Illuminate blocks with red/green glow to show clear path
- disable two players in one boat
- Fix interacting bug with boats to respawn at spawn point. (have them sneak out)

### Tree Decorating:

- Disable fucking explosives and lava.
    - disable spawning any type of entity
    - disable firework rockets
    - disable TNT minecarts
- Autogive players decorations so that their first thought is not to desecrate the tree!

## Donations:

- Christmas tree that grows with each donation
- Donations progress bar somehow.
- "Chaos" donations -> drop TNT in a spleef game, for example.

## Stream:

- Drumroll while rolling givaway?H

# PlayTest Notes:

### Bauble Tag Stuff

- add remaining players in the sidebar for bauble tag.

Extra considerations:

- fix bossbar colours
- also rework avalanche roof designs/ideas.
- Remove glowstone from forest map.
- work out scoring ratio (games like paint wars cant add 4000+ points)
- fix the END button to be in winner overview as well.
